  <h2>Welcome To My WebSite!</h2>
  <p>
  Today’s leaders must inspire and collaborate, not micromanage, to drive agility and innovation in their organisations.
  They must focus on their customers, learn from mistakes and create an agile culture that continuously improves their products and services and the way they work.
  With over 6+ years experience, I have worked as an in-house developer, consultant, project manager and entrepreneur ranging from Fortune 500 companies to Start-up companies
  I have seen agility and customer experience done well. I’ve also seen it done poorly.
  My background in business, IT and engineering ensures that the customer’s voice and products are front and center in every discussion we have.
  With this broad, diverse experience I am uniquely qualified to bring the ideas of product discovery, business agility and digital transformation to your teams.
